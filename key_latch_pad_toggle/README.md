# KeyLatchPadToggle

> **_KeyLatchPadToggle_** is tailored for the Akai MPK mini and Vengeance Sound's VPS Avenger in Logic Pro.

The script offers two main features:

1. Key latching: While a note is held down, subsequent presses of the same note will not trigger another instance of the note. This is useful for extended chord playing and other use cases.

2. Pad toggling: The MPK pads can be used to toggle states in the VPS Avenger plugin when set to MIDI CC mode. This enables you to control various parameters of the plugin with your pads.


By combining these features, you can create more expressive and dynamic performances with the Akai MPK mini and the Vengeance Audio VPS Avenger in Logic Pro.
